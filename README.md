# Stride - Fitness Data Visualizer

Fitness Data Visualizer is a powerful CLI application designed to streamline the management and visualization of fitness data. It works seamlessly with Apple Health & Fitness data, automatically importing and processing data from iCloud Drive. This application provides a convenient way to access, filter, and display your fitness information.

## Key Features

- **Automated Data Imports**: Leverages the iOS app, _Health Auto Export_, to import data from Apple Health into iCloud Drive.
- **Flexible Data Processing**: Aggregates data from iCloud Drive into a local cache, reducing redundant calls and improving performance.
- **Customizable Data Output**: Supports multiple flags and arguments to tailor data visualization.
- **Extensive Format Support**: Handles CSV or JSON exports with configurable aggregation settings.
- **Cloud and API Support**: Compatible with various cloud storage providers and REST APIs.

  fitness -f name -v "Pool Swim"      # Show only Pool Swim workouts
  fitness -sort duration -desc        # Sort by duration descending
  fitness -i "name,duration,distance" # Show only specific fields
```

## Examples

- Show 10 items in compact mode:

  ```bash
  fitness -n 10 -c
  ```

- Display only "Pool Swim" workouts:

  ```bash
  fitness -f name -v "Pool Swim"
  ```

- Sort by duration in descending order:

  ```bash
  fitness -sort duration -desc
  ```

- Display specific fields:
  ```bash
  fitness -i "name,duration,distance"
  ```

## Prerequisites

- iOS device with _Health Auto Export_ installed.
- iCloud Drive configured to store Apple Health data.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jaysaavedra18/apple-fitness-health-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd apple-fitness-health-app
   ```
3. Build the application:
   ```bash
   go build
   ```
4. Run the CLI:
   ```bash
   ./fitness
   ```

## How It Works

1. **Data Export**: Use _Health Auto Export_ to define data points, format (CSV/JSON), and frequency of export.
2. **Data Import**: The CLI imports data from iCloud Drive and caches it locally.
3. **Data Visualization**: Use the CLI flags to customize and display your fitness data.
